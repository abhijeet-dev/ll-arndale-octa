* Hisilicon HiP04 Clock Controller

The HiP04 clock controller generates and supplies clock to various
controllers within the HiP04 SoC.

Required Properties:

- compatible: should be one of the following.
  - "hisilicon,hip04-clock" - controller compatible with HiP04 SoC.

- reg: physical base address of the controller and length of memory mapped
  region.

- #clock-cells: should be 1.


Each clock is assigned an identifier and client nodes use this identifier
to specify the clock which they consume.

All these identifier could be found in <dt-bindings/clock/hip04-clock.h>.
