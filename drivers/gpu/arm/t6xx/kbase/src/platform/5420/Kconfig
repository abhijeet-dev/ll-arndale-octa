	  Choose this option to enable locking the DVFS frequency.  If sysfs
	  support is enabled files will be created for inspecting and
	  (potentially) setting a fixed DVFS frequency.  This is used
	  for debugging; enable only if you know what you are doing.

config MALI_HWC_TRACE
	bool "Enable hardware counter event tracing support"
	depends on MALI_T6XX && MALI_EXPERT
	default n
	help
	  Choose this option to enable collecting hardware counter data
	  with system trace events.  This is typically used for debugging
	  but has minimal overhead when not in use. Enable only if you
	  know what you are doing.
